# Publishers theses policies

## General terms for re-use
* You always have to give a proper, full citation and use the DOI to link to the published version! 
* Please check publishers &quot;[Special requirements](#policies)&quot; in column 4!
* Listed below are *general* terms. Obtain permission to use a different version, shorten the embargo period, or the like. Most publishers handle permissions with help of the [RightsLink service](http://www.copyright.com/rightsholders/rightslink-permissions/) by the Copyright Clearance Center.

## Hybrid journals
* Many publishers have hybrid business models for all or some journals, so called hybrid journals. These journals generally charge subscription fees for access, while single articles are published open access after paying an open access fee (Article Processing Charge, APC).
* If these single open access articles are published under an open content license (e.g. Creative Commons) there are a wider re-use options than described in the [table below](#policies).

## Glossary
* Preprint: originally submitted version; synonyms: submitted version, author’s original version
* Postprint: version of an article that reflects all changes made during the review process, but that is not layouted by the publisher or enhanced otherwise; synonyms: accepted manuscript, accepted version, peer-reviewed version, final draft
* Published version: final, published version; synonyme: publisher PDF, version of record, final version
* Embargo: some publishers permit delayed self-archiving or other re-use, i.e. upon expiry of an embargo period
